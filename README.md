Search By Photo AI feature

Search by photo feature is already available by Google , Facebook etc in internet. This implementation of mine is to search photo of any person in local folders.

Steps to use the feature
1. Clone the project or Copy the python code to your local system files.
2. Add required libraries or modules.
3. Run the python file and you will be asked for user input(file location) for a reference photo of one person.( A clear photo is recommended )
4. Provide folder location in the next user input where the search will be done.
5. Photos found will be displayed in the screen with the face red boxed.
